# near-lake-s3
near-lake-s3 is used to sync the certain blocks from AWS S3 buckets to redis server. The block must contain transactions/receipts related to specified account.

## How to build?

```shell
cargo build --release
```

The binary file "near-lake-s3" will be generated in ./target/release.

## How to Run

### AWS S3 Credentials

In order to be able to get objects from the AWS S3 bucket you need to provide the AWS credentials.

AWS default profile configuration with aws configure looks similar to the following:

`~/.aws/credentials`
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
```

### Env Config

You can copy env.example to .env, modify it and put it in the same directory with near-lake-s3 (or it's parent directory).

maybe you can install the [redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) for the following configuration.

```
// Start from cache if true ignore START_BLOCK_HEIGHT
START_BLOCK_HEIGHT_FROM_CACHE=false
START_BLOCK_HEIGHT=0

// The URL of the redis
REDIS_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379"
// Redis list name where the block will push to
PUB_LIST="blocks"

// The account name to watch
MCS="mcs.testnet"

// True for NEAR tesnet, false for NEAR mainnet
TEST=true

// Log file
LOG_FILE="./near-lake.log"

// Log level
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```


### Run
```shell
./target/release/near-lake-s3
